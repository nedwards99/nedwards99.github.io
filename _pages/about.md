Hi! I'm Nick, a first-year PhD student at the University of Vienna supervised by [Sebastian Schuster](https://sebschu.com/). I'm interested 

Previously, I received a BA in Linguistics from the University of Cambridge, followed by an MSc in Speech & Language Processing from the University of Edinburgh. During my time at Edinburgh, I did research in emergent communication between neural networks with [Hannah Rohde](http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~hrohde/) and [Henry Conklin](https://hconklin.com/).

You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
